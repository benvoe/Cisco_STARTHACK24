# Socialiser - connect people in companies

## A submission to START Hack 2024 - CISCO Challenge

Team "BembelEngineers" from TU Darmstadt and ETH Zürich.
Members: Kevin Riehl, Leon Bernard, Benedikt Völker

Based on WiFi-Localisation data, we learn a social network graph, that is analysed to identify gaps in corporate network structure and actively suggests informal meetings for exchange and getting together.
